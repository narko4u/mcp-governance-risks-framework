# MCP Governance & Risk Framework

[![OpenSSF Best Practices - Baseline 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestpractices.dev%2Fprojects%2F14148.json&query=badge_percentage_baseline_1&label=OpenSSF%20Baseline%201)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/14148)

A practical governance framework for organizations adopting the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), the open standard that lets AI agents connect to external tools, data sources, and systems.

MCP adoption is accelerating across engineering teams. Agents can read wikis, open pull requests, post to Slack, and trigger production workflows often at machine speed and without the user seeing every intermediate step. This repository provides a structured way to answer the central governance question:

> **Should this MCP server be allowed in our environment, and under what controls?**

| [framework-mapping.md](framework-mapping.md)                                   | **Framework mapping**: control mappings to OWASP MCP Top 10, OWASP LLM Top 10, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, and SOC 2 |

### Framework v1.0 scope

The v1.0 guide covers six core chapters plus a closing appendix. Treat the content in three layers: **policy** (Chapters 1 and 3), **controls** (Chapters 2–6 and the appendix control catalog), and **checklists** (chapter-end and appendix practitioner checklists). Compliance framework mappings live in the companion [framework-mapping.md](framework-mapping.md) document.

1. [Chapter 1: Executive Summary](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-1-executive-summary)
2. [Chapter 2: Why MCP Needs Governance](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-2-why-mcp-needs-governance)
3. [Chapter 3: MCP Governance Principles](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-3-mcp-governance-principles)
4. [Chapter 4: MCP Asset Inventory](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-4-mcp-asset-inventory)
5. [Chapter 5: MCP Server Classification Model](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-5-mcp-server-classification-model)
6. [Chapter 6: MCP Risk Scoring Model](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-6-mcp-risk-scoring-model)
7. [Appendix: Closing](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#appendix-closing) — control catalog, evidence pack, authorization test cases, detection and incident response, and practitioner checklist

## Start here by role

### CISO / Security leadership

Read [Chapter 1: Executive Summary](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-1-executive-summary) for the business case, four non-negotiable governance rules, and a 90-day rollout plan. Use the [Practitioner Checklist](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#practitioner-checklist) in the appendix before presenting to a risk committee.

### AppSec / Security architecture

Start with [Chapter 2](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-2-why-mcp-needs-governance) and [Chapter 3](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-3-mcp-governance-principles), then implement [Chapter 4: Asset Inventory](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-4-mcp-asset-inventory) and the [Classification Model (Chapter 5)](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-5-mcp-server-classification-model). Use [framework-mapping.md](framework-mapping.md) for OWASP and compliance control mappings; use [reference.md](reference.md) for MCP authorization spec, OWASP MCP Top 10, and other external sources.

### Engineering / Platform teams

Review the [Tier 0–4 classification summary](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#step-2-classify-existing-servers) and [Recommended First Steps](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#recommended-first-steps). Understand that servers are classified by their **highest-risk tool**, not by server name alone.

### Legal / Privacy / Procurement

Focus on data scope, third-party server review, and vendor trust factors in [Chapter 5](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-5-mcp-server-classification-model) and [Chapter 6: Risk Scoring](mcp-governance-risk-framework-v1.0.md#chapter-6-mcp-risk-scoring-model). Use [framework-mapping.md](framework-mapping.md) for audit and compliance alignment; external policy references are in [reference.md](reference.md).

## Key governance rules

These four rules are designed to be adopted as organizational policy:


| Rule                                     | Implication                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No owner = No approval**               | Every MCP server requires a named owner before approval    |
| **No logging = No production use**       | Servers without audit trails cannot operate in production  |
| **No scope definition = No access**      | Data and action scope must be documented before connection |
| **No review = No enterprise deployment** | Periodic review is mandatory by risk tier                  |


---

## Quick start (30 days)

1. **Inventory**: Capture every known MCP server, including suspected shadow deployments
2. **Classify**: Assign Tier 0–4 based on the highest-risk tool each server exposes
3. **Score**: Apply the eight-factor risk model for nuanced decisions
4. **Publish policy**: Adopt the four governance rules and tier-based control requirements
5. **Assign owners**: Name business and technical owners for every Tier 2+ server
6. **Report metrics**: Track inventory coverage, shadow MCP count, and overdue reviews monthly

| Tier  | Description                  | Example                             | Approval authority                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **0** | Public data, read-only       | Public docs, weather API            | Lightweight review                     |
| **1** | Internal, non-sensitive read | Internal wiki search                | Security + business owner              |
| **2** | Sensitive read               | CRM, HR knowledge base              | Security + data owner                  |
| **3** | Write-capable                | GitHub PR merge, CI/CD trigger      | Security architecture + platform owner |
| **4** | Privileged / critical        | Cloud admin, IAM, production deploy | CISO or risk board                     |

## External references and compliance mapping

- **[framework-mapping.md](framework-mapping.md)** maps guide controls to OWASP MCP Top 10, OWASP LLM Top 10, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and SOC 2 — use this for audits, gap assessments, and program integration.
- **[reference.md](reference.md)** consolidates external links for MCP specification and authorization requirements, OWASP and NIST/ISO source documents, and MCP security community resources and CVE tracking.
